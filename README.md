## Group 7: Nicole Hinojosa, Saqeena Thapa & Vanshika

## Introduction:

In this project, we aim to systematically address a series of computational biology questions by leveraging R for data analysis and visualization. Our approach involved several key steps: first, we meticulously analyzed the problem statements and identified the necessary datasets and methods required for each point. We implemented robust coding practices to ensure that our solutions not only provide accurate answers but are also reproducible and easy to understand.

To enhance collaboration and version control, we utilized a GitHub repository where all team members contributed their expertise and enhance transparency. This README file details the purpose of each script, along with their inputs and outputs, which facilitates easier navigation and understanding for future users.

Throughout the code, we prioritized clarity by incorporating sufficient comments that elucidate the functionality of each code segment. This documentation will assist others in grasping the methodology and rationale behind our solutions, promoting knowledge sharing and educational growth within the computational biology community.

## Part 1. Task 1

In this task, we aim to analyze gene expression data by reading a file containing gene identifiers and their expression values. We'll display the first six genes to understand the dataset, calculate the mean expression for each gene, identify the top 10 genes with the highest mean expression, count how many genes have a mean expression below 10, and visualize the distribution of low-expression genes using a histogram plot. This analysis will help us understand gene expression patterns and identify potential candidates for further investigation.


### Download data and read it

The following code downloads a gene expression dataset from a specified GitHub repository and then reads that dataset into R as a data frame. This allows for further analysis and processing of the gene expression data in subsequent steps.

```r
#Download the data from the github link provided
URL = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ghazkha/Assessment4/refs/heads/main/gene_expression.tsv"
download.file(URL, destfile = "gene_expression.tsv")

# Read the downloaded TSV file into R
gene_expression <- read.table("gene_expression.tsv", header = TRUE, sep = "\t", row.names = 1)
```

#### Inputs: 
URL: A string that specifies the location of the dataset on GitHub. In this case, it points to a TSV (tab-separated values) file containing gene expression data.

destfile: A string that specifies the name of the file to be saved locally.

#### Outputs:
Downloaded File: The code downloads the file from the specified URL and saves it in the working directory with the name "gene_expression.tsv".

Data Frame: The code reads the downloaded TSV file into R and stores it in a variable called gene_expression. The resulting data frame will:
- Have the first row of the file treated as column headers (header = TRUE).
- Use the first column of the file as row names (row.names = 1).
- Be structured with tab (\t) as the separator between values.


### Inspecting the data frame

The purpose of this code is to display the first six rows of the gene_expression data frame. This allows users to quickly inspect the structure and content of the data, ensuring that it has been loaded correctly and giving an overview of the gene expression values.

```r
# View the first few rows of the data
gene_expression_show <- head(n=6, gene_expression)
#Give format to the table
kable (gene_expression_show, align = 'c', caption = "First 6 genes of gene_expression file")
```

#### Inputs:
gene_expression: This is the data frame that was previously created by reading the gene expression data from a TSV file. It contains gene expression information where rows correspond to genes and columns correspond to different conditions or samples.

n=6: This argument specifies the number of rows to be displayed, in this case, the first six rows.

#### Outputs:
Console Output: The variable gene_expression_show will hold the first six rows of the gene_expression data frame, which will be printed to the console when called.

Formatted Table: The kable() function formats the gene_expression_show data frame into a neatly structured table with the following attributes:

  -Alignment: Centered columns (align = 'c').
  -Caption: "First 6 genes of gene_expression file", providing context to the displayed data.
  

### Calculate Mean Expression

This code calculates the mean expression level for each gene across all samples and add it as a new column to the gene_expression data frame.

```r
# Calculate the mean across the samples and add as a new column
gene_expression <- gene_expression %>%
  mutate(mean_expression = rowMeans(select(., everything())))
# Show a table of values for the first six genes including the mean
gene_expression_show <-head(n=6, gene_expression)
# Give format to a table
kable (gene_expression_show, align = 'c', caption = "First 6 genes of gene_expression file")
```

#### Inputs:
gene_expression: The data frame containing gene expression data, with rows for genes and columns for different expression values across samples.

select(., everything()): This function selects all columns in the data frame to compute the row means.

#### Outputs:
Updated gene_expression Data Frame: The original data frame is modified to include a new column named mean_expression, which contains the mean expression value for each gene calculated across all samples.

Console Output: The variable gene_expression_show holds the first six rows of the updated gene_expression data frame, which will be printed to the console when called.

Formatted Table: The kable() function creates a neatly formatted table displaying the first six genes along with their mean expression values. This table includes:

  -Alignment: Centered columns (align = 'c').
  -Caption: "First 6 genes of gene_expression file", providing context to the displayed data.
  
  
###Identify Top 10 Genes

The top 10 genes can be identified and list using the highest mean expression values from the gene_expression data frame, showed in the following code.

```r
# List the 10 genes with the highest mean expression
top_genes <- gene_expression %>%
  arrange(desc(mean_expression)) %>%
  head (n=10) 
# Print the top genes in a table
kable (top_genes, align = 'c', caption = "Top 10 expressed genes")
```

#### Inputs:
gene_expression: The data frame containing gene expression data, including the mean_expression column.

#### Outputs:
Updated top_genes Data Frame: A data frame containing the top ten genes sorted by their mean expression values in descending order.

Formatted Table: The kable() function generates a neatly formatted table displaying the top ten expressed genes, including:

  -Alignment: Centered columns (align = 'c').
  -Caption: "Top 10 expressed genes", providing context for the data presented.
  

### Count and Plot the Genes with Low Expression (Mean < 10)

This code determines the number of genes with a mean expression value less than 10, prints this count, and creates a histogram to visualize the distribution of these low mean expression values. It also saves the histogram plot to a file for inclusion in a report.

```r
# Determine the number of genes with a mean < 10
num_genes_below_10 <- sum(gene_expression$mean_expression < 10)

# Print the number of genes
cat(format(num_genes_below_10), "\n")

# Make a histogram plot of the mean values
filtered_data <- gene_expression[gene_expression$mean_expression < 10, ]
ggplot(filtered_data, aes(x = mean_expression)) +
  geom_histogram( binwidth = 1, fill = "orange", color = "black") +
  labs(title = "Histogram of Mean Low Gene Expression", x = "Mean Expression", y = "Frequency") +
  theme_minimal()

# Save the plot to your report

## Conclusion

In this assignment, we explored various aspects of gene expression and biological sequence diversity. Initially, we analyzed RNA-seq count data from the file "gene_expression.tsv," calculating the mean expression for each gene and identifying the top 10 genes with the highest mean values, along with determining how many genes had a mean expression below 10. The histogram of mean expression values provided a visual representation of the distribution, highlighting patterns in gene activity across the samples.

Next, we examined tree growth data from "growth_data.csv," comparing tree circumference measurements taken at a control site and a treatment site over a 20-year period. We calculated the mean and standard deviation of tree circumference at both the start and end of the study, visualized the data through box plots, and assessed growth over the last decade using t-tests to evaluate significant differences between the sites.

Part 2 of the assignment focused on comparing the sequence features of *Streptacidiphilus jiangxiensis* to *E. coli*. We downloaded and analyzed coding DNA sequences, tabulating the number of coding sequences and their total length, and identified differences in coding sequence lengths between the organisms. We also calculated the frequency of DNA bases and amino acids, generating bar plots to illustrate these frequencies. Codon usage bias was quantified and compared, providing insights into the evolutionary strategies of the two organisms. Finally, we identified and compared k-mers, revealing significant differences in sequence representation between the two genomes.

Through this comprehensive analysis, we not only gained a deeper understanding of gene expression and tree growth patterns but also explored the genetic diversity and evolutionary implications of coding sequences in two distinct bacterial species. This integrative approach highlighted the importance of bioinformatics in elucidating the complexities of biological systems.
