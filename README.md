# Assesssment 4: Bioinformatics final project.

## Introduction:
In this project, we aim to systematically address a series of computational biology questions by leveraging R for data analysis and visualization. Our approach involved several key steps: first, we meticulously analyzed the problem statements and identified the necessary datasets and methods required for each point. We implemented robust coding practices to ensure that our solutions not only provide accurate answers but are also reproducible and easy to understand.

To enhance collaboration and version control, we utilized a GitHub repository where all team members contributed their expertise and enhance transparency. This README file details the purpose of each script, along with their inputs and outputs, which facilitates easier navigation and understanding for future users.

Throughout the code, we prioritized clarity by incorporating sufficient comments that elucidate the functionality of each code segment. This documentation will assist others in grasping the methodology and rationale behind our solutions, promoting knowledge sharing and educational growth within the computational biology community.
